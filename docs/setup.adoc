= Setup

Add to your lein or boot dependencies:

```
[tick "0.4.0-alpha"]
```

== Serialization 

There are many use cases for de/serialization of dates, including simply being able to 
copy and paste within the REPL. Tick bundles https://clojars.org/jsr310-tagged-literals[jsr310-tagged-literals]
Clojure(Script) library, so having require'd tick, in your code or at the repl you can type

----
#jsr310/period "P1D"
----

which is read as a java.time.Period (or js-joda Period in ClojureScript).

To read and write edn data containing these literals in Clojure(Script) and for more information generally, see
the https://github.com/henryw374/jsr310-tagged-literals[tagged literals Readme]
