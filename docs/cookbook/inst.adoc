== Instants and Inst

To get the current instant:
====
[source.code,clojure]
----
(t/instant)
----

[source.code,clojure]
----
(t/now)
----
====

Create a specific instant:
====
[source.code,clojure]
----
(t/instant "2000-01-01T00:00:00.001")
----
====

Convert inst to and from instant:
====
[source.code,clojure]
----
(t/instant (t/inst))
----

[source.code,clojure]
----
(t/inst (t/instant))
----
====

NOTE: tick's default is `java.time.Instant` but caters for projects that use
`java.util.Date` by the conversions above. It is recomended when using tick to
keep as an instant for as long as possible.
