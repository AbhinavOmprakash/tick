== Countdown timers

[.lead]
Creating a countdown timer greatly depends on the length of time being counted and the accuracy required.


For a simple timer, usually only hours minutes and seconds are required:

----
(defn countdown-HH-mm-ss
  [end-time]
  (let [duration (tick/duration
                  {:tick/beginning (tick/instant)
                   :tick/end end-time})
        hours (tick/hours duration)
        minutes (tick/minutes (tick/- duration
                                      (tick/new-duration hours :hours)))
        seconds (tick/seconds (tick/- duration
                                      (tick/new-duration minutes :minutes)
                                      (tick/new-duration hours :hours)))]
    (if (tick/< (tick/instant) end-time)
      (format "%02d:%02d:%02d"
              hours minutes seconds)
      "Time's up!")))
----


For longer durations, counting to high precision is unnecessary. If we are counting down the weeks, knowing how many seconds
remain is for the most part meaningless.

----
(defn countdown-weeks
  [end-time]
  (let [duration (tick/duration
                  {:tick/beginning (tick/instant)
                   :tick/end end-time})
        weeks (long (tick/divide duration (tick/new-duration 7 :days)))
        days (t/days (t/- duration
                          (t/new-duration (* weeks 7) :days)))
        hours (tick/hours (tick/- duration
                                  (t/new-duration (+ days (* weeks 7)) :days)))]
    (if (tick/< (tick/instant) end-time)
      (format "%d weeks, %d days, %d hours"
              weeks days hours)
      "Time's up!")))

If you  do not know the units of time that are going to be counted down, you may require a more general countdown function.

----
(defn countdown-generic
  "Gives a map of the countdown with units of time as keys."
  [end-time]
  (let [duration (tick/duration
                  {:tick/beginning (tick/instant)
                   :tick/end end-time})
        weeks (long (tick/divide duration (tick/new-duration 7 :days)))
        days  (t/days (t/- duration
                           (t/new-duration (* weeks 7) :days)))
        hours (tick/hours (tick/- duration
                                  (t/new-duration (+ days (* weeks 7)) :days)))
        minutes (tick/minutes (tick/- duration
                                      (t/new-duration (+ days (* weeks 7)) :days)
                                      (t/new-duration hours :hours)))
        seconds (tick/seconds (tick/- duration
                                      (t/new-duration (+ days (* weeks 7)) :days)
                                      (t/new-duration hours :hours)
                                      (t/new-duration minutes :minutes)))
        millis (tick/millis (tick/- duration
                                    (t/new-duration (+ days (* weeks 7)) :days)
                                    (t/new-duration hours :hours)
                                    (t/new-duration minutes :minutes)
                                    (t/new-duration seconds :seconds)))]
    (if (tick/< (tick/instant) end-time)
      {:counting true
       :weeks weeks
       :days days
       :hours hours
       :minutes minutes
       :seconds seconds
       :milliseconds millis}
      {:counting false})))

It may be required that the time _since_ an event is calculated. In this can be done in a very similar way to counting down:

----
(defn count-up
  "Gives the time since an event in the most appropriate units of time"
  [event]
  (let [duration (tick/duration
                  {:tick/beginning event
                   :tick/end (tick/instant)})
        years (long (tick/divide duration (tick/new-duration 365 :days)))
        months (long (tick/divide duration (tick/new-duration (/ 365 12) :days)))
        weeks (long (tick/divide duration (tick/new-duration 7 :days)))]
    (cond
      (> (t/days duration) 365)
      (format "%d years" years)

      (and (<= (t/days duration) 365) (> (t/days duration) (/ 365 12)))
      (format "%d months" months)

      (and (<= (t/days duration) (/ 365 12)) (> (t/days duration) 7))
      (format "%d weeks" weeks)

      (and (<= (t/days duration) 7) (> (t/days duration) 1))
      (format "%d days" (t/days duration))

      (and (<= (t/days duration) 1) (> (t/hours duration) 1))
      (format "%d hours %d" (t/hours duration))

      (and (<= (t/hours duration) 1) (> (t/minutes duration) 1))
      (format "%d minutes %d" (t/minutes duration))

      (and (<= (t/minutes duration) 1) (> (t/seconds duration) 1))
      (format "%d seconds" (t/seconds duration))

      (tick/< (tick/instant) event)
      "Event hasn't happened yet")))

CAUTION: These timers have lower accuracy at higher precisions - they do not account for leap seconds or years.
