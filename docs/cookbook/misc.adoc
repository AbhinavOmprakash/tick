====
Give the am pm time:
----
(defn twelve-hour-time
  "Takes a time and gives the 12 hour display"
  [t]
  (let [minute (t/minute t)
        hour (t/hour t)]
    (cond
      (= (t/noon) t)
      "12:00 NOON"

      (>= hour 13)
      (format "%02d:%02d PM" (- hour 12) minute)

      (>= hour 12)
      (format "%02d:%02d PM" hour minute)

      (< hour 12)
      (format "%02d:%02d AM" hour minute))))

----
NOTE: "12 noon is by definition neither *ante meridiem* (before noon) nor *post
meridiem* (after noon), then 12 a.m. refers to midnight at the start of the
specified day (00:00) and 12 p.m. to midnight at the end of that day (24:00)"

Get the days in a year
----

(filter #(or (= (t/SATURDAY) (t/day-of-week (first %)))
             (= (t/SUNDAY) (t/day-of-week (first %))))
        (t/divide-by (t/new-duration 1 :days) (t/bounds (t/year))))

----
(= (t/MONDAY) (t/day-of-week (first (first (t/divide-by (t/new-duration 1 :days) (t/bounds (t/year)))))))
