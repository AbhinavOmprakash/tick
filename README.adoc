= tick

A Clojure(Script) library for dealing with time. Intended as a
replacement for clj-time.

Based on Java 8 time (on the JVM) and js-joda (on JavaScript
runtimes).

[source,clojure]
----
(require [tick.alpha.api :as t])

;; Get the current time
(t/now)
----

== Status

Alpha: Ready to use with the caveat that the API might still undergo
minor changes.

== Install

Add to your `project.clj`, `build.boot` or `deps.edn`:

```
[tick "1.0-alpha-1"]
```

== Development

=== with Clojure

REPL with nREPL server

----
clj -Adev
----

Port is written to `.nrepl-port`.

Run tests with:

----
clj -Atest -e deprecated
----

=== with ClojureScript

From the Clojure REPL type `(node)`.

For testing, we are still using Leiningen:

----
lein doo node test
----

== Acknowledgements

Tick is based on the same original idea as
https://github.com/jarohen/chime[Chime]. The motivation is to be
able to view timelines of remaining times while the schedule is
running. Thanks to James Henderson for his work on Chime.

In particular, special credit to Eric Evans for discovering Allen's
interval algebra and pointing out its potential usefulness,
demonstrating a working implementation of Allen's ideas in
link:https://github.com/domainlanguage/time-count[his Clojure library].

Thanks also to my esteemed colleagues Patrik Kårlin for his redesign of
the interval constructor function, and Henry Widd for porting to cljc.
