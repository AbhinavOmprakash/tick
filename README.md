# tick

A Clojure library for dealing with time.

## java.time

Most Clojure time libraries use clj-time, but tick uses *java.time*

which means that it requires Java 8.

## Timelines

Tick adds the concept of *timelines* to java.time. A timeline is a
lazy sequence of `java.time.ZonedDateTime` instances.

Timelines are easy to generate. One generator is `periodic-seq`, which
generates a uniform series of times separated by a fixed period.

```clojure
(require '[tick.core :as t])

;; A timeline of 15 minute intervals
(t/periodic-seq (t/clock) (t/minutes 15))
```

## Schedules

Schedules are created by composition from building blocks.
