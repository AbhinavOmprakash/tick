# tick

A Clojure library for dealing with time.

## Timelines

Tick adds the concept of immutable *timelines* to java.time. A
timeline is a lazy but orderered sequence of `java.time.ZonedDateTime`
instances.

Timelines are easy to generate. One generator is `periodic-seq`, which
generates a uniform series of times separated by a fixed period.

```clojure
(require '[tick.core :as t])

;; A timeline of 15 minute intervals
(t/periodic-seq (t/clock-ticking-in-seconds) (t/minutes 15))
```

Timelines are just sequences, so can be transformed, filtered and can
have transducers applied.

Timelines can be finite or infinite.

Timelines are composeable, and `merge-timelines` takes a collection of
timelines and returns a lazy sequence of the result of their
amalgamation.

```clojure
(merge-timelines
  (bank-holiday-mondays)
  (easter-fridays))
```

## Tickers

A ticker is something that travels across a timeline.

One such ticker, useful for testing, can be created with `simulate`.

```clojure
(def simulator (t/simulate println timeline))
```

You can think of this as similar to map, but applied to timelines
rather than sequences.

Tickers can be `start`ed with a clock, and if necessary, `stop`ed.

```clojure
(start simulator (t/fixed-clock ...))
```

## Real time

A schedule is another type of ticker, executing a function across a
timeline.

```clojure
(def schedule (t/schedule println timeline))

(start schedule (t/clock-ticking-in-seconds))
```

If you want to wait for a ticker to complete its journey over a
timeline, `deref` the result of `start`.

At any time after starting a ticker you can find out its future
timeline with `timeline`, while inspecting its clock with `clock`.

## java.time

Most Clojure time libraries use clj-time, but tick uses
[**java.time**](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/java/jf14-date-time-2125367.html)
which means that it requires Java 8.

Java 8's `java.time` API is both influenced by, and superior to, Joda
Time. It is a modern immutable API that supports functional
programming. Unless you're stuck on Java 7 or ambivalent about library
choice, you should be using `java.time`.

## Discussion

The 'flow of time' complicates our systems and we can simplify them if
we separate the concept of a timeline from the 'flow' of time we
perceive.

For more information, see the author's talk at ClojuTRE-2016 on [The
Universe As A Value](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odPAkEO2uPQ)
where he argues that time is a perception.

## Acknowledgements

Tick is based on the same original idea as
[Chime](https://github.com/jarohen/chime). The motivation is to be
able to view timelines of remaining times while the schedule is
running. Thanks to James Henderson for this work on Chime.
