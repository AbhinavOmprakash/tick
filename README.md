# tick

A Clojure library for dealing with time.

## java.time

Most Clojure time libraries use clj-time, but tick uses
[**java.time**](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/java/jf14-date-time-2125367.html)
which means that it requires Java 8.

## Timelines

Tick adds the concept of immutable *timelines* to java.time. A timeline is a
lazy sequence of `java.time.ZonedDateTime` instances.

Timelines are easy to generate. One generator is `periodic-seq`, which
generates a uniform series of times separated by a fixed period.

```clojure
(require '[tick.core :as t])

;; A timeline of 15 minute intervals
(t/periodic-seq (t/clock-ticking-in-seconds) (t/minutes 15))
```

Timelines are just sequences, so can be transformed, filtered and can
have transducers applied.

## Tickers

A ticker travels across a timeline. Tickers can have different behaviours.

```clojure
(def ticker (t/schedule println timeline))
```

Tickers can be `start`ed with a `clock`, and if necessary, `stop`ed.

```clojure
(start s (t/clock-ticking-in-seconds))
```

If you want to wait for a ticker to complete its journey over a timeline, `deref` the result of `start`.

Another ticker, useful for testing, can be created with `simulate`.

```clojure
(def test-ticker (t/simulate println timeline))

(start s (t/fixed-clock ...))
```

## Acknowledgements

Tick is based on the same original idea as [Chime](https://github.com/jarohen/chime). The motivation is to be able to view timelines of remaining times while the schedule is running. Thanks to James Henderson for this work on Chime.
