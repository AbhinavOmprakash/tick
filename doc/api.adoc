= API

_tick_ provides a single namespace—`tick.api`—containing the functions that make up the library's API.

CAUTION: Try to restrict your use of `tick` to the `tick.api` namespace. Functions in other namespaces, which may not be marked private, are not part of the official API and could change.

The code examples in this documentation assume that you have referred
all _tick_'s API symbols into the current namespace. You can do this in
the REPL with the following:

----
(use 'tick.api)
----

When you are using _tick_ in programs, it is a recommended idiom that you require _tick_'s api under the `t` alias as follows:

----
(require '[tick.alpha.api :as t])
----

If you choose to do this, then remember to prefix the symbols in this documentation with `t/`. For example, `(now)` would become `(t/now)`.
