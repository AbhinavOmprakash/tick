= Introduction

Tick is designed as a comprehensive library of time utilities designed
to make it easier to write Clojure programs that involve time and date
calculations.

== Comparison to other time libraries

=== Java 8 time

Most Clojure time libraries use clj-time, but tick uses
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/java/jf14-date-time-2125367.html[**java.time**]
which means that it requires Java 8 or higher.

Java 8's `java.time` API is both influenced by, and an improvement on, Joda
Time. It is a modern immutable API that supports functional
programming.

=== clj-time and Joda Time

NOTE: TBD

=== clojure.java-time

NOTE: TBD

=== Quartz

== Status

Tick is currently in _alpha_ status.
