= API

_tick_ provides a single namespace containing a number of functions that make up the supported API to the library. You should try to restrict your usage of `tick` to these functions, since functions in other namespaces are liable to change.

The code examples in this documentation assume that you have referred
all _tick_'s API symbols into the current namespace. You can do this in
the REPL with the following:

----
(use 'tick.api)
----

When you are using _tick_ in programs, it is recommended that you require _tick_'s api under the `t` alias as follows:

----
(require '[tick.alpha.api :as t])
----

If you choose to do this, then remember to prefix the symbols in this documentation with `t/`. For example, `(now)` would become `(t/now)`.


= Times and dates

In _tick_, times and dates are values from Javaâ„¢'s `java.time` package.

== Construction

=== Times

If you asked a stranger for the time, you'd hopefully get an answer,
something like "15 minutes to midnight". It would be uncommon for them
to tell you the date and timezone also, unless you asked for it.

The idea of the 'local' time, that you might read on a wall clock, is
still a useful concept. From a functional programming perspective, you
might think of this as 'partial evaluation' as applied to time.

[%header,cols="m,a,m"]
|===
|Example|Description|Return type
|(time)|The time now, as local time|java.time.LocalTime
|(time "4pm")|16:00, local time|java.time.LocalTime
|(midnight)|Midnight|java.time.LocalTime
|(noon)|Noon|java.time.LocalTime
|===

=== Dates

To get the current date, call `(today)`. This will return a `java.time.LocalDate`.

[%header,cols="m,a,m"]
|===
|Example|Description|Return type
|(today)|Today's date|java.time.LocalDate
|(date "2017-01-20")|The date 20th February 2017|java.time.LocalDate
|===

=== Date-times

Date-times represent a particular time on a particular date.

`(time "8pm")` gives a `java.time.LocalTime`, but for any date. Suppose you want that on a particular date, say Valentine's Day in 2018. You need to reify (a word meaning to 'make concrete') that time with a date to make a date-time.

----
(-> (time "8pm") (on "2018-02-14"))
----

The same idea works the other way around. If you have a date, say 2017-02-14, and want to fix a time on that date, say 8pm.

----
(-> (date "2018-02-14") (at "8pm"))
----

In both cases, a `java.time.LocalDateTime` is returned.



NOTE: TODO ZonedDateTime, OffsetDateTime

[%header,cols="m,a,m"]
|===
|Example|Description|Return type
|(noon (today))|Noon today|java.time.LocalDateTime
|(-> (time "8pm") (on "2018-02-14"))|8pm on 2018-02-14|java.time.LocalDateTime
|(-> (date "2018-02-14") (at "8pm"))|8pm on 2018-02-14|java.time.LocalDateTime
|===

=== Instants

Instants are points in time.

To get the instant representing the current time, call `(now)`. This will return a `java.time.Instant` at the most precision possible on your platform (the nearest millisecond, microsecond or nanosecond).

[%header,cols="m,a,m"]
|===
|Example|Description|Return type
|(now)|The time now (millisecond granularity)|java.time.Instant
|(epoch)|Constant for the 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z epoch instant|java.time.Instant
|===


== Derivation

=== Reification


=== Adjustment

NOTE: TODO Adjusters

NOTE: Increment/decrement to create tomorrow,yesterday

[%header,cols="m,a,m"]
|===
|Example|Description|Return type
|(midnight (today))|Midnight, last night (since midnight is the start of the day)|java.time.LocalDateTime
|(tomorrow)|Tomorrow's date|java.time.LocalDate
|(yesterday)|Yesterday's date|java.time.LocalDate
|===


=== Truncation

You might not need millisecond (or nanosecond) accuracy, so you can truncate to the nearest second `(truncate (now) :seconds)` (or nearest minute with `(truncate (now) :minutes)`).

|(nanos 1200)|Duration of 1200 nanoseconds|java.time.Duration
|(days 100)|Duration of 100 days|java.time.Duration
