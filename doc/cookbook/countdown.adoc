== Countdown timer

[.lead]
Creating a countdown timer greatly depends on the length of time being counted and the accuracy required.


For a simple timer, usually only hours minutes and seconds are required:

----
(defn countdown-HH-mm-ss
  [end-time]
  (let [duration (tick/duration
                  {:tick/beginning (tick/instant)
                   :tick/end end-time})
        hours (tick/hours duration)
        minutes (tick/minutes (tick/- duration
                                      (tick/new-duration hours :hours)))
        seconds (tick/seconds (tick/- duration
                                      (tick/new-duration minutes :minutes)
                                      (tick/new-duration hours :hours)))]
    (if (tick/< (tick/instant) end-time)
      (format "%02d:%02d:%02d"
              hours minutes seconds)
      "Time's up!")))
